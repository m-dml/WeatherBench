```

To start out download either the entire 5.625 degree data (175G) using 
```shell
wget "https://dataserv.ub.tum.de/s/m1524895/download?path=%2F5.625deg&files=all_5.625deg.zip" -O all_5.625deg.zip
```
or simply the single level (500 hPa) geopotential data using
```shell
wget "https://dataserv.ub.tum.de/s/m1524895/download?path=%2F5.625deg%2Fgeopotential_500&files=geopotential_500_5.625deg.zip" -O geopotential_500_5.625deg.zip
```
and then unzip the files using `unzip <file>.zip`. You can also use `ftp` or `rsync` to download the data. For instructions, follow the [download link](https://mediatum.ub.tum.de/1524895).


## Baselines and evaluation
 **IMPORTANT:** The format of the predictions file is a
  NetCDF dataset with dimensions `[init_time, lead_time, lat, lon]`. Consult the notebooks for examples. You are
   stongly encouraged to format your predictions in the same way and then use the same evaluation functions to ensure
    consistent evaluation.
### Baselines
The baselines are created using Jupyter notebooks in `notebooks/`. In all notebooks, the forecasts are saved as a
 NetCDF file in the `predictions` directory of the dataset. 
 
### CNN baselines
An example of how to load the data and train a CNN using Keras is given in `notebooks/3-cnn-example.ipynb`. In
 addition a command line script for training CNNs is provided in `src/train_nn.py`. For the baseline CNNs in the
  paper the config files are given in `src/nn_configs/`. To reproduce the results in the paper run e.g. `python -m src.train_nn -c src/nn_configs/fccnn_3d.yml`. 
  
### Evaluation
Evaluation and comparison of the different baselines in done in `notebooks/4-evaluation.ipynb`. The scoring is done
 using the functions in `src/score.py`. The RMSE values for the baseline models are also saved in the `predictions
 ` directory of the dataset. This is useful for plotting your own models alongside the baselines.


## Data processing
The dataset already contains the most important processed data. If you would like to download a different variable
, regrid to a different resolution or extract single levels from the 3D files, here is how to do that!

### Downloading and processing the raw data from the ERA5 archive

The workflow to get to the processed data that ended up in the data repository above is: 
1. Download monthly files from the ERA5 archive (`src/download.py`)
2. Regrid the raw data to the required resolutions (`src/regrid.py`)

The raw data is from the ERA5 reanalysis archive. Information on how to download the data can be found 
[here](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/How+to+download+ERA5) and 
[here](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api-how-to). 

Because downloading the data can take a long time (several weeks), the workflow is encoded using [Snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/). See `Snakefile` and the configuration files for each variable in `scripts/config_
{variable}.yml`. These
 files can be modified if additional variables are required. To execute Snakemake for a particular variable type
 : `snakemake -p -j 4 all --configfile scripts/config_toa_incident_solar_radiation.yml`.
 
In addition to the time-dependent fields, the constant fields were downloaded and processed using `scripts
/download_and_regrid_constants.sh`
 
### Downloading the TIGGE IFS baseline

To obtain the operational IFS baseline, we use the [TIGGE Archive](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/TIGGE
). Downloading the data for Z500 and T850 is done in `scripts/download_tigge.py`; regridding is done in `scripts
/convert_and_regrid_tigge.sh`.

### Regridding the T21 IFS baseline

The T21 baseline was created by Peter Dueben. The raw output can be found in the dataset. To regrid the data `scripts
/convert_and_regrid_tigge.sh` was used.

### Extracting single levels from 3D files

If you would like to extract a single level from 3D data, e.g. 850 hPa temperature, you can use `src
/extract_level.py`. This could be useful to reduce the amount of data that needs to be loaded into RAM. An example
 usage would be: `python extract_level.py --input_fns DATADIR/5.625deg/temperature/*.nc --output_dir OUTDIR --level 850`
